# RaspberryPi-as-IP-Camera
This project turns the Raspberry Pi camera into an IP camera. The frames are streamed from the Raspberry Pi using Flask. The code for the Raspberry Pi is in the raspberry_ip_camera directory.  They can be recieved by any device like a computer or another Raspberry Pi connected to the same network using the capture_stream.py script.
